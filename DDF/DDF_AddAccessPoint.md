# Adding an Access Point

## This is a TEST

Adding an access point requires you to log into the Cleo Integration Cloud server to get a script that you then run on the machine where you want to add the access point.

You can run the script on a local machine or a remote machine.

1. Log in to the server.
2. Go to the Access Points page.
3. Click the Add Access Point button. 
4. Fill in the fields and select an OS.  
The script to install the local software and instructions on how to run the script appear on the page.  
5. Copy the script and run it on the machine where you want to install the local software.

After you add an access point, you are ready to add data stores.

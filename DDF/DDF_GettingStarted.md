# Getting Started with DDF

To get started with DDF, you install _agents_ and you create _access points_ and _data stores_ on local systems. You create _data flows_ that contain _actions_ to connect the data stores and perform operations on your data as it moves from data store to data store.

+ [Adding an Access Point](/DDF_AddAccessPoint.html)&mdash;Adding an Access Point requires you to log into the Cleo Integration Cloud server to get a script that you then run on the machine where you want to add the Access Point.
+ [Adding a Data Store](/DDF_AddingDataStores_task.html)&mdash;_Data Stores_ are the file transfer end points for your DDF system. They reside on _Access Points_.
+ [Creating Data Flows](/DDF_CreatingDataFlows_task.html)&mdash;A _data flow_ connects two _data stores_data stores such that files can be transferred between them.
